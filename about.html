            <h4>More About Our Lab.</h4>
            <p>We are a group of colleagues & friends who shares the passion and love for coding. We're always finding time to code out of work so we can say it's one of our hobbies.</p>
            <p>Our background is mainly .NET technologies (C#, asp.net, webforms, MVC, WebAPIs, WPF, LINQ, Entity Framework, WinForms, SignalR, ... etc) but each one has a specialization (Design Patterns, SQL Server, Unity, Web Design, UX, Mobile Hybrid Apps, Xamarin, Android, iOS,...).</p>

            <p>All of the projects have been created and developed by our members in our free time, when the work, family and friends let us write some code. We just want to learn all of the new interesting technologies while developing new sites and apps trying to be functional someway to people.</p>
