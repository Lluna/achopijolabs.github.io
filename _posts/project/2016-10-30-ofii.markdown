#### Ofii
Ofii is a project that will try to be the assistant of any worker worldwide whose work environment is an office. The objective of this project is to create a kind of co-worker to help you with day to day in certain aspects of daily work that at the moment I can not reveal :)

This project development starts on July '16 and it's planned to be finished and ready to launch by the beginning of next year (2017).
