#### The Hour
The hour is a project currently in an early stage. It is initially planned to have web application and mobile app created in xamarin for iOS and android. It's my first project with a business plan so it's going to take a while in the design and construction.

I can't reveal more details but in future posts I'll be evaluating some features and technologies to use because I haven't decide the main technologies for the mobile app (Xamarin or Ionic 2), the Database (SQL Server or NoSql -mongo or couchbase-) and the website (ASP.Net MVC vs Angular 2).
